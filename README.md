Welcome to Orinav!

Orinav is a new navigation app for people with visual impairments, produced through the research project "Multitasking Mobile Outdoors Navigation for People with Visual Impairments." Orinav seeks to integrate macro-navigation (route planning) and micro-navigation (environment awareness) in one cohesive experience to reduce friction when navigating.

* Navigate: Orinav provides step-by-step route guidance tailored with accessibility enhancements, including more frequent announcements, real-time direction guidance, and instant instruction replay by shaking your phone.
* Explore: Orinav implements machine learning-powered computer vision to detect obstacles, traffic lights, and tactile paving, supporting real-time decision-making for safe movement.

Orinav is currently under a source-available model.
