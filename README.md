# Beacon

Story of self, story of us, story of now.

Maybe... we can do something?

## Development Setup

**Prerequisites.** Xcode and CocoaPods.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `pod install`. (Due to size constraints, we added `Pods` to `.gitignore`)
3. Open `BeaconNext.xcworkspace` in Xcode. Do not open `BeaconNext.xcodeproj`.
4. Build and run. (Development is typically done on a test device or iOS emulator)
